    "A data scientist is in charge of developing the weekly production plan of two key products that the furniture factory makes: chairs and tables. The data scientist using machine learning techniques predicts that the selling price of a chair is $\\$45$ and the selling price of a table is $\\$80$ dollars. There are two critical resources in the production of chairs and tables:\n",
    "Mahogany (measured in board square-feet) and labor (measured in work hours). There are 400 units of mahogany available at the beginning of each week, and there are 450 units of labor available during each week. The data scientist estimates that one chair requires 5 units of mahogany and 10 units of labor. One table requires 20 units of mahogany and 15 units of labor. The marketing department has told the data scientist that ALL the production of chairs and tables can be sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to create a production plan that maximizes total revenue.\n",
    "\n",
