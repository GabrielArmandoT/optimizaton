    "## The Furniture Factory Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A data scientist is in charge of developing the weekly production plan for two key products that the furniture factory makes: chairs and tables.  Using machine learning techniques, the data scientist predicts that the selling price of a chair is $\\$45$ and the selling price of a table is $\\$80$ dollars. There are two critical resources in the production of chairs and tables:\n",
    "mahogany (measured in board square-feet) and labor (measured in work hours). There are 400 units of mahogany available at the beginning of each week, and there are 450 units of labor available during each week.\n",
    "\n",
    "![data_scientist](data_scientist.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The data scientist estimates that the production of one chair requires 5 units of mahogany and 10 units of labor and the production of one table requires 20 units of mahogany and 15 units of labor. The marketing department has told the data scientist that all chairs and tables that are produced will be sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "![BOM](BOM.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to create a production plan that maximizes total revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create such a production plan, we need to decide how many chairs and tables to make in order to maximize total revenue, while satisfying resource constraints. This problem has two decision variables:\n",
    "* x1: number of chairs to produce.\n",
    "* x2: number of tables to produce. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of chairs and tables to produce should be a non-negative number. That is, x1, x2 ≥ 0. The data of this furniture problem is presented in the table below. \n",
    "\n",
    "![problem_summary](problem_summary.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know the amount of chairs to produce (x1), then since each chair generates $\\$45$, the total revenue generated by the production of chairs can be determined by the term 45x1 ($45*x1$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the total revenue generated by the production of tables can be determined by the term 80x2 ($80*x2$). Consequently, the total revenue generated by the production plan can be determined by the following equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Revenue} = 45x1 + 80x2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The production plan is constrained by the amount of resources available. How do we ensure that the production plan does not require more mahogany than the amount of mahogany available? If we decide to produce x1 number of chairs, then the total amount of mahogany required for the production of chairs is 5x1 ($5*x1$). Similarly, if we decide to produce x2 number of tables, then the total amount of mahogany required for the production of tables is 20x2 ($20*x2$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the total consumption of mahogany by the production plan, determined by the values of x1 and x2. is ($5x1 + 20x2$). However, the consumption of mahogany by the production plan cannot exceed the amount of mahogany available. We can express these ideas in the following constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "5x1 + 20x2 \\leq 400\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In similar fashion, we can formulate the constraint for labor resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total amount of labor resources required for the production of chairs is 10 labor units multiplied by the number of chairs produced, that is 10x1 ($10*x1$). The total amount of labor resources required for the production of tables is 15 labor units multiplied by the number of tables produced, that is 15x2 ($15*x2$). Therefore, the total consumption of labor resources by the production plan, determined by the values of x1 and x2, is \n",
    "($10x1 + 15x2$). This labor consumption cannot exceed the labor capacity available. Hence, this constraint can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "10x1 + 15x2 \\leq 450\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the linear programming formulation of the Furniture Factory Problem follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Max} \\; \\text{Revenue} = 45x_{1} + 80x_{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Subject to the following constraints:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Mahogany} : 5x_{1} + 20x_{2} \\leq 400\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
